# Altered Extracts

This mod changes all extracts that usually require you to either:
1. have a friendly Scav with you (impossible in Single Player), or
2. require payment,
   
into normal extracts that require neither of those things.

Because Coop extracts are completely broken by it being single player, and finding 5000 rubles just to use a paid extract is just daft busy work that is almost impossible on some maps (Woods!) BSG should allow item value bartering to use them but that'll never happen, so let's get these gone.

These extracts are now 66% chance of being active and take 8 seconds to extract from.
No config file needed here, if you desperately hate the chance percentage or exfil time, then change it in the code directly but they're pretty standard.
